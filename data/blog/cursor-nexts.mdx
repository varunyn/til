Process Overview: Migrating to Next.js App Router with View Transitions
Discovery & Inspiration:
Watched a YouTube video introducing View Transitions in CSS.
Decided to implement this feature in your Next.js app (til.varunyadav.com).
Initial Attempt & Realization:
Asked Cursor to help implement View Transitions.
Faced issues; learned through research that the feature is experimental and only supported in Next.js App Router (not Page Router).
Decision to Migrate:
Decided to migrate from Page Router to App Router to enable View Transitions.
Used Cursor to create a new git branch and guide the migration process.
Refactoring & Dependency Updates:
Discovered outdated packages (e.g., mdx-remote v4).
Upgraded or removed unnecessary dependencies (e.g., switched to built-in MDX support in Next.js, dropped mdx-remote).
Asked Cursor targeted questions about package usage, necessity, and alternatives.
Additional Improvements:
Enhanced sitemap generation.
Improved Google Analytics integration to track requests on every page.
Outcome & Reflections:
The migration and refactoring process involved about 50 Cursor requests.
Cursorâ€™s assistance significantly accelerated the process compared to manual work.
The experience highlighted the value of asking specific, targeted questions during refactoring.
