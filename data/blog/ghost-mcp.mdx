Today, while scrolling through X (formerly Twitter), I came across a post about MCP (Model Control Panel). In the replies, someone casually mentioned GhostMCP, and I thoughtâ€”wait, whatâ€™s that?

Curious, I did a quick Google search and found the GhostMCP GitHub repository. It turns out, GhostMCP is an open-source Model Control Panel designed to run locally, giving you a minimal UI to interact with different LLMs in a streamlined way.

#### Quick Install on Cursor

I tested it out quickly using Cursor (the AI-powered code editor), and it worked surprisingly well! However, I noticed the README in the GitHub repo doesn't provide local setup instructions specifically for Cursor users, so I thought Iâ€™d share the exact steps I followed to get it up and running.

Steps to Set Up GhostMCP Locally with Cursor

1. First, clone or download the project from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/MFYDev/ghost-mcp.git
cd ghost-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. In Cursor, open your MCP settings and modify the relevant section to point to the GhostMCP server script. Update the configuration like this:

````json
"command": "node",
"args": [
  "path-to/ghost-mcp-main/build/server.js"
],```

Make sure to replace path-to with the actual path to your local ghost-mcp directory.
