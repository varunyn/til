### Install via Hombrew

```shell
brew install node@<version>

# latest version
brew install node

# LTS 12
brew install node@16

# 18
brew install node@18
```

Check current version of node

```shell
    node -v # v13.11.0
    which node # /usr/local/bin/node => /usr/local/opt/node@<version>/bin/node
```

Add an alias to your .zshrc or .bash_profile for each installed Node version. Node is installed at `/usr/local/opt/node@<version>/bin`

```bash
alias node13='export PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@13/bin:$PATH"'
alias node12='export PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@12/bin:$PATH"'
alias node10='export PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@10/bin:$PATH"'
```

Now, to switch between the node versions, enter an alias node10 in your terminal. Execute node -v to verify that you are now using the correct node version.
