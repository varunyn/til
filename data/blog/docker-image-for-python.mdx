Dockerfile

```docker
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
ENTRYPOINT [ "python" ]
CMD [ "app.py" ]
```

Sample Flask app to try containerize

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "<p>Hello, World!</p>"

port = 5100

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=port)

```

and then start the app using

```shell
python app.py
```

I am using slim image instead of alpine. Good [article](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/alpine-docker-python/) on why not to use alpine for python.
Official Docker [docs](https://docs.docker.com/language/python/build-images/) for building python image.
