That's why instead of waiting to write a perfect post or store it in my laptop it's good idea to write in public so that everyone can see the progress and can give feedback in the process.\n\nI got this inspiration from [Shawn](https://twitter.com/swyx). In his [blog](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) he says\n\n> Start building a persistent knowledge base that grows over time. At every step of the way: Document what you did and the problems you solved.\n\nJoel describes \"digital garden\" in his [blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)\n\n> The phrase \"digital garden\" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting \"showpiece\" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.\n\nFollowing article by Maggie Appleton explains digital garden very well.\n\n[A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)\n\nFew Notes from her post:\n\n- Gardens lean into this – there is no “final version” on a garden. What you publish is always open to revision and expansion.\n\n- You’re freed from the pressure to get everything right immediately. You can test ideas, get feedback, and revise your opinions like a good internet citizen.\n\n- It’s _low friction_. Gardening your thoughts becomes a daily ritual that only takes a small amount of effort. Over time, big things grow.\n\n- Some sort of indicator of ‘how’  done is article. Horticulture metaphor:\n\n  - 🌱 _Seedlings_ for very rough and early ideas\n  - 🌿 _Budding_ for work I’ve cleaned up and clarified\n  - 🌳 _Evergreen_ for work that is reasonably complete (though I still tend these over time).\n\n- In my posts, I will use similar tags to convey how done is article.\n","slug":"learning-in-public"},{"title":"Webmentions in Nextjs","date":"2021-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","desc":"How to use webmentions in nextjs","tags":["nextjs"],"content":"\nArticles on impementing webmentions in nextjs:\n\n- https://aboutmonica.com/blog/getting-started-with-webmention-next-js\n- https://www.swyx.io/clientside-webmentions/\n","slug":"webmentions-in-nextjs"}],"tag":"nextjs"},"__N_SSG":true}
