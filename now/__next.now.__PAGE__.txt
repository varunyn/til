It's been roller coaster when adding complexity- I use Cursor for writing code and it makes lot of big changes to the application even when not needed. After long battle when all the features are working figure out it is making way to many calls in Firebase so went on another battle to reduce calls, cache data when needed. Currently I am the only user but it sure does feels good to make good app which I can see myself using on regular basis. Well today I learned about Oracle SQLcl MCP and used that to connect to Oracle ATP 23ai to create tables and ORDS.

I had this problem last week where my Compute VM didn't have enough CPU to build docker image. Workaround solution is to build locally and then push it.
