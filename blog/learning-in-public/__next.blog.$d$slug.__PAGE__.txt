3:T8e0,<p>This blog/repo is a Digital Garden where I store my thoughts and pieces of information which I find helpful and you may find too.</p>
<p>There is lot of information out there and to remember all or organizing them in notes which often get lost is very difficult. That's why instead of waiting to write a perfect post or store it in my laptop it's good idea to write in public so that everyone can see the progress and can give feedback in the process.</p>
<p>I got this inspiration from <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx">Shawn</a>. In his <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">blog</a> he says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Start building a persistent knowledge base that grows over time. At every step of the way: Document what you did and the problems you solved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joel describes "digital garden" in his <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden">blog</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.</p>

<p>Following article by Maggie Appleton explains digital garden very well.</p>
<p><a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">A Brief History &#x26; Ethos of the Digital Garden</a></p>
<p>Few Notes from her post:</p>
<p>- Gardens lean into this – there is no “final version” on a garden. What you publish is always open to revision and expansion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You’re freed from the pressure to get everything right immediately. You can test ideas, get feedback, and revise your opinions like a good internet citizen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s <em>low friction</em>. Gardening your thoughts becomes a daily ritual that only takes a small amount of effort. Over time, big things grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some sort of indicator of ‘how’  done is article. Horticulture metaphor:</p>
<ul>
<li>🌱 <em>Seedlings</em> for very rough and early ideas</li>
<li>🌿 <em>Budding</em> for work I’ve cleaned up and clarified</li>
<li>🌳 <em>Evergreen</em> for work that is reasonably complete (though I still tend these over time).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my posts, I will use similar tags to convey how done is article.</p>
