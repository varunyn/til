Today, while scrolling through X (formerly Twitter), I came across a post about MCP (Model Context Protocol). In the replies, someone casually mentioned GhostMCP, and I thought—wait, what’s that?

Curious, I did a quick Google search and found the GhostMCP GitHub repository. It turns out, GhostMCP acts as a secure bridge, allowing AI models to manage your Ghost blog’s content, users, members, tiers, offers, and newsletters via the Ghost Admin API.

#### Quick Install on Cursor

I tested it out quickly using Cursor (the AI-powered code editor), and it worked surprisingly well! However, I noticed the README in the GitHub repo doesn't provide local setup instructions specifically for Cursor users, so I thought I’d share the exact steps I followed to get it up and running.

Steps to Set Up GhostMCP Locally with Cursor

1. First, clone or download the project from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MFYDev/ghost-mcp.git
cd ghost-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. In Cursor, open your MCP settings and modify the relevant section to point to the GhostMCP server script. Update the configuration like this:

```json
"command": "node",
"args": [
  "path-to/ghost-mcp-main/build/server.js"
],
```

Make sure to replace path-to with the actual path to your local ghost-mcp directory.

- We can do this by creating our own chrome extension with shortcuts for the URLs that we want to open.
- Create manifest.json and background.js files in same folder.

manifest.json

```json
{
  "name": "Bookmark Shortcuts",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Custom shortcuts for URLs",
  "permissions": ["tabs"],
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "all_frames": true,
      "js": ["background.js"],
      "run_at": "document_end"
    }
  ],
  "manifest_version": 3
}
```

background.js

```js
if (window == top) {
  window.addEventListener('keyup', doKeyPress, false);
}

var bookmarks = {},
  url;

bookmarks['G'] = 'https://google.com';

function doKeyPress(event) {
  if (event.ctrlKey && !event.shiftKey) {
    if ((url = bookmarks[String.fromCharCode(event.keyCode)])) {
      console.log('URL', url);
      window.open(url);
    }
  }
}
```

- Within chrome, type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and activate developer mode on the top right (switch).
- Click on the Load unpacked button that appeared and select your folder containing the files.
- Now press `ctrl+g` on keyboard and it will open google in new tab.

This blog/repo is a Digital Garden where I store my thoughts and pieces of information which I find helpful and you may find too.

There is lot of information out there and to remember all or organizing them in notes which often get lost is very difficult. That's why instead of waiting to write a perfect post or store it in my laptop it's good idea to write in public so that everyone can see the progress and can give feedback in the process.

I got this inspiration from [Shawn](https://twitter.com/swyx). In his [blog](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) he says

> Start building a persistent knowledge base that grows over time. At every step of the way: Document what you did and the problems you solved.

Joel describes "digital garden" in his [blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)

> The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.

Following article by Maggie Appleton explains digital garden very well.

[A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

Few Notes from her post:

- Gardens lean into this – there is no “final version” on a garden. What you publish is always open to revision and expansion.

- You’re freed from the pressure to get everything right immediately. You can test ideas, get feedback, and revise your opinions like a good internet citizen.

- It’s _low friction_. Gardening your thoughts becomes a daily ritual that only takes a small amount of effort. Over time, big things grow.

- Some sort of indicator of ‘how’  done is article. Horticulture metaphor:
  - 🌱 _Seedlings_ for very rough and early ideas
  - 🌿 _Budding_ for work I’ve cleaned up and clarified
  - 🌳 _Evergreen_ for work that is reasonably complete (though I still tend these over time).

- In my posts, I will use similar tags to convey how done is article.
